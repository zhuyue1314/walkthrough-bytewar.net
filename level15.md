#### Level 15

Here we need to manually generate a serial key, so first hit the search button and we get:
```
5413-09649-4236
7561-15929-8368
```
And now we need to find out what these have in common. It's easy to see that the middle segment is the sum of the first and last. So lets try 5000-10000-5000.

Nope not valid, lets study more. First segment is odd, middle is odd and last is even in both serials. Then lets try 5001-10001-5000...

There you go, easy!
